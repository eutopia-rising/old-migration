## Saturday, December 21  
12:00 PM – 4:00 PM

Let’s all get comfy and get together to enjoy some Saturday morning cartoons! Come in your comfiest pajamas or onesie and bring your favorite cuddle pals to Eutopia Rising’s first Cuddle Party.

There will be many comfy places, cereal, and cartoons provided. Bring your coziest self and as many blankets, stuffed animals, and pillows as you would like!

Cereal and cuddles are on the menu, enjoy as much or as little as you desire. Get ready for some chill times and together we’ll become lumps and turn our space into Lumpy Space!

Gluten free and dairy free options will be provided.

**Time:** Cuddles start at noon, and linger into the afternoon. No admission after **3pm** without prior approval.

**Space:** A cute little place called Horizon. Details provided upon ticket purchase.

**Fashion Mandate:** PJs, onesies, oversized sweaters, or whatever makes you feel comfy.

**Consent Policy:** Nothing should ever happen to you at one of our events that you do not clearly and enthusiastically consent to. Violators of this policy will be firmly ejected from any event we host.

**Accessibility Notice:** Unfortunately, the venue we have secured is not wheelchair accessible. Guests will need to be able to climb a single flight of stairs to reach the space, and the building does not have an elevator. We apologize that we are not able to better accommodate all interested folk with this event; we’ll strive to provide better options at future events.
