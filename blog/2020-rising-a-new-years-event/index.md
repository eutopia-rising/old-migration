## Tuesday, December 31st  
8pm – 4am

_Eutopia Rising is throwing a New Year’s Party! The future is about to begin and we need you to build a vision of it with us. We're going to deck the walls of Horizon with some colossal canvases and we're inviting our creative voyagers to collaboratively create a mural fitting for our journey into the new age._

_Resident artist/space commander Janet has set up a game that communicates its arcane algorithmic painting methodology, and it includes uses for your and your friends’ bodies and minds. Art skills appreciated but by no means required! At the turn of the year, find someone to kiss, make noise, drop a ball, and enjoy our assortment of equipment, cozy blankets, and comfy air furniture._

**2020 Rising is open open only to** [**vetted and approved Lunar Voyagers**](https://eutopia-rising.org/apply/)**.**

Do not buy a ticket if you have not been approved! You will not be admitted and your admission will not be refunded. If you are planning to come as part of a couple or group, **ALL** members of your party must fill out an application and be approved separately.

In order to keep this sexy event running, please be generous in selecting the ticket tier you can comfortably afford.

If you would like to volunteer in exchange for a comped or reduced-price ticket, contact [volunteers@eutopia-rising.org](http://mailto:volunteers@eutopia-rising.org/)!

**Time**: The future begins at **8pm** with art, games and refreshments. **Doors close at 11pm** to prepare for the countdown. No admittance after this point without prior arrangement. From midnight on, we celebrate and play in whatever way feels right. At **4am** it's time to head out and embrace a new world. Maybe watch the sun rise before you sleep.

**Space**: A place in Brooklyn we call Horizon. Details provided upon ticket purchase.

**Fashion Mandate:** Wear something you don't mind getting covered in paint (or something you specifically want to get painted). Getting messy isn't a requirement, but it might be fun. A supply of tee shirts will be available to use as smocks if you don't bring your own. After midnight, if you'd like to get more fabulous, we'll have a pile of costumes on hand to play around with.

**Consent Policy:** Nothing should ever happen to you at one of our events that you do not clearly and enthusiastically consent to. Violators of this policy will be firmly ejected from any event we host.

**Accessibility Notice:** Unfortunately, the venue we have secured is not wheelchair accessible. Guests will need to be able to climb a single flight of stairs to reach the space, and the building does not have an elevator. We apologize that we are not able to better accommodate all interested folk with this event; we’ll strive to provide better options at future events.
