**Voyagers: check your email for the ticket link!**

We are inviting the city’s most promising boinkers to join us under the tend this upcoming Pi(e) Day for the next sensational season of Brooklyn’s most famous underground baking-show-themed competitive daytime sex party.

Eutopia Rising is back with our unique blend of games, fun, puns, and sticky buns. Expect icebreaking entremets, scandalous signature moves, tricky technical challenges, and mouth-watering showstoppers. We will have hosts, judges, and prizes that will be given out throughout the day to our star boinkers. All you need to bring is your delicious self.

Don’t worry if you don’t feel like competing, there’s no pressure to put yourself up to be judged for your techniques. Perhaps you’d like to cook up your own hot human sandwich in one of our cuddle tents. Maybe you’d just like to snack on tea and cookies while watching

But if there’s a competitive desire rising in you, a drive to show off your goods in front of an adoring crowd, or if just the thought of a steely and disapproving glare from one of our judges makes you quiver like a layered trifle -- we hope you’ll consider stepping up and proving your skills. Our judges will shake the hand of one star boinker in each category, and at the end of the competition one of you is going home with the grand prize.

Everyone else will hopefully go home very happy and otherwise satisfied in every way, having enjoyed a very silly, sexy, and relaxed daytime event. Home baked snacks and beverages will be available, but guests are also encouraged to bring their own treats to share if they so desire. Your bakes will not be judged, only shared and enjoyed.
