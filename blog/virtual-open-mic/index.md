Some recommendations: a piece of poetry you enjoy, something you have written, fun facts or a quick lesson about an expertise or a hobby you have, an experimental piece of performance art, a karaoke song, an interpretive dance...

We invite you to get creative for yourself and for us all, for up to 7 minutes on camera & microphone via zoom.

NSFW content is fine, please just inform us beforehand so we may offer a disclaimer/CW before introducing your set.

Bigotry of any kind has no place on this platform

You do not need to share in order to view!

Looking forward to seeing you online!
