Tickets Here: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ms-polyjuiced-presents-a-fine-afternoons-dicksmithing-registration-91878768871](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ms-polyjuiced-presents-a-fine-afternoons-dicksmithing-registration-91878768871)

**In this exclusive four-hour hands-on workshop, locally renowned phallic artist Ms. Polyjuiced will lead you through the complete process of crafting your very own homemade artisanal dildo.** You’ll be taught how to sculpt a prototype, how to cast a silicone mould, coloring and mixing the liquid rubber, and how to add personal touches like glitter or other inserts. Under Ms. Polyjuiced’s careful guidance, you’ll be creating an utterly unique toy that will last for generations to come.

**The workshop will be hosted in Ms. Polyjuiced’s underground Brooklyn crafting parlour - address details revealed upon ticket purchase.** Light fare including sandwiches and snacks will be provided, along with a selection of teas, soda, and other beverages.

Prospective pupils are encouraged to come prepared with a design concept for the dick they desire to create. A drawing or photo is advised, although many samples will also be on hand for reference and inspiration. All necessary materials will be provided, including vibrating motors for those who prefer their dick accompanied by mild buzz.

For those interested in more true-to-life sculpture, Ms. Polyjuiced is happy to guide students through the art of life body casting. This is an especially tricky process, as live dicks are notoriously difficult to work with, but the results can be very rewarding. **If you are interested in bringing your own live dick model, please contact Ms. Polyjuiced in advance to discuss necessary arrangements.**

The art of dicksmithery is a complex and tricky one, but with proper guidance and determination, it should be well within the grasp of anyone willing to put in the effort. Disappointment is always a risk when exploring new things, and we cannot guarantee that every pupil will go home with the finished product they hoped to create. However, everyone will certainly leave us will a solid grounding in the multifaceted art of silicone sculpting, and will have enjoyed a lovely Sunday afternoon making art with other like-minded deviants along the way.

Students who have purchased a ticket and attended one workshop but find they still need more time to complete their projects at the end of the afternoon are welcome to come back and attend another class at a later date at no additional charge.
