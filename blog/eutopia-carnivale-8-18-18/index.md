**Coordinates:** A secret location in Brooklyn. Details provided upon ticket purchase.

**Fashion Mandate:** Be the glorious future you see just over the horizon. Retropunk tribal new-wave ballroom glam, afrofuturist cyberpunk club scene, genderfabulous posthuman sparklediva. Deck your beautiful body in gold, glitter, neon, chrome, leather, latex, LEDS, rainbows, and glory. But please, **no clowns**. Clowns are creepy, not sexy. Seriously, do not come dressed as a clown.

**Consent Policy:** Nothing should ever happen to you at one of our events that you do not clearly and enthusiastically consent to. Violators of this policy will be firmly ejected from any event we host.

**Accessibility Notice:** Unfortunately, the venue we have secured is not wheelchair accessible. Guests will need to be able to climb a single flight of stairs to reach the space, and the building does not have an elevator. We apologize that we are not able to better accommodate all interested folk with this event; we'll strive to provide better options at future events.
