**NEVER SURRENDER** continues because life always finds a way. We continue to be what we have always been. We are a chill space for good times with good people. We are a party and a protest, a ritual and a revel. We are a circle of love spitting naked defiance at a world in crisis.

For the time being, our play space is a virtual one, and we may all need to learn some new ways to get close across distance. Have faith: our great thirst has always lead us to great resourcefulness.

_Here's how you do:_

- **Dress up your nest:** set up your webcam in a comfy place with good lighting. Lay out fresh sheets and get all your favorite equipment handy. Maybe light a candle or put up a few decorations to set the mood.
- **Put on your best:** take out that corset or leather harness or silk teddy or fancy fancy panties that you've had gathering dust in your naughty drawer since lockdown came down. Doll yourself up special and wear whatever makes you feel the most sexy.
- **Join the Zoom:** a videoconferencing link is your ticket to the party. We encourage you to have your video feed on of course, so we can see how beautiful you are. We will start with introductions and welcomes and some general conversation to get comfortable. Things get more interesting from there.

_Schedule of the night:_

**9:15pm -** We start the welcome circle, just as always. Introduce yourself, share your intentions, put your hopes out there, let us know what song you've had on repeat this past month. Tell us a bit about who you are, what you're hoping to do, and what you'd like to see...

**10:30pm -** As folk begin to play, we'll ask you to mute your mic except for sounds of pleasure. We'd like to tun our main virtual floor into a rotating spotlight of scenes, as we all show off for each other. The hosts will keep the spotlight moving, selecting to focus on wherever the action is happening at that moment. Raise your hand if you want to be seen.

We will have a few separate breakout rooms set up in our virtual venue, and our hosts will help direct you to where you'd like to be. If you wish to continue chatting, we'll send you to a Chill Room, where you can continue to talk and schmooze and hang. If you'd like to go off somewhere with a select group of attendees, we'll set you up with a private room where you can have fun together.

**2:00am -** You don't have to go home because you never left. Maybe get some sleep? Or maybe don't. Our hosts will likely be signing off, but you don't have to say goodbye. Stay up till dawn and perhaps we can all watch the same sunrise from each of our bedroom windows.

Talk, play, show off, or just be a witness to the magic. Make loud noises. Leave marks. Make memories. We fill the night with our sounds and our sensations. We hold out as long as we can. We will not surrender.

Join us.
