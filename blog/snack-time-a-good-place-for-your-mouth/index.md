Hey.   
Like, you’re really...   
I mean, not to be weird or anything, but...  
You’re um. I just wanted to say...  
You’re looking pretty _tasty_.   

Here’s the thing and maybe you’re into it. There’s going to be a night for nibbles and noms and maybe necking. Is that even still a thing? Do people neck? Ok, this is awkward. Let me start over.  

Snack Time is an event for snacks and also for snacks. Tasty treats and tasty friends. Munchies and makeouts. No pressure, just cute peeps and cute times. We provide the snacks, tunes, a cuddly space and some fun saucy games. You just show up in your tastiest wrapping, ready to get your lips moist. Bring your sweetie or roll in solo, you’ll meet yummy new friends either way.  

Nobody should ever feel pressured to do anything at all that they’re not into, whether that’s putting your mouth on someone else or trying out some weird black candy. However, you should come expecting that folk of all sorts of genders will maybe want to smoosh your cute face. Eutopia Rising is a queer-centered collective, and we are affirmatively welcoming to every kind of orientation, all sorts of bodies, and every gender under the rainbow. All kissin’, no judgin’.   

Our scrumptious Eutopian crew will be on hand to help with introductions and icebreakers, and to make sure everyone is feeling safe and comfy. Feel free to bring your own snacks or games to share with others, or toys to show off.  

This makeout event is exclusively for our vetted lunar voyagers -- check your email for the ticket link. If you’re not yet on our list, now’s the perfect time: [https://eutopia-rising.org/apply/](https://eutopia-rising.org/apply/)
