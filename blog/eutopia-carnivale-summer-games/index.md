Prepare for a night of carnal competition and erotic athleticism unlike anything else out there. We’re taking you out to a whole new ball game, and a night filled with exotic sensations, sexy games, intimate exploration and unbridled ecstasy.

Prepare for events and awards, flirty games, and all the silly erotic fun that you’ve come to expect from the Eutopia Rising crew. Do you have what it takes to enter our Equestrian Events, as either mount or mounted? Excited to bound over Consenting Human Hurdles? Dying to get sweaty and throw down in our center-stage Greco-Roman Wrestling arena? Or would prefer to just hang out in the locker rooms, getting oiled up and rubbed down by your teammates? 

There’s something for everyone at the inaugural 2019 Summer Games. Whether you play offense or defense, whether you’re a player or a spectator, we’re happy to have you on our team. And we’re hoping to hear you cheer.

Come with us.

Eutopia Carnivale is a recurring play party hosted at our secret Brooklyn venue, open open only to [**vetted and approved Voyagers**](https://goo.gl/forms/7efFqP05OXGZiOEM2). Our crew runs a variety of sexytimes events with a focus on silly games, enthusiastic consent, and erotic experimentation. In the interests of maintaining better accountability and creating a growing community of trust, we only offer tickets to people who have told us a bit about themselves first and made it past our vetting team. Red flags will not be tolerated on our field. If you can’t demonstrate that you play well with others, you can’t play with us.

Interested in joining our select team of all-stars? [**Become a Voyager.**](https://goo.gl/forms/NymSROUtaNPORhK52)  

Reduced or comped admission available for volunteers and staff — contact **[events@eutopia-rising.org](mailto:events@eutopia-rising.org)** if you’d like to be involved.

**Game Time:** Our gates open wide at **8pm**. Come early for opening ceremonies featuring our consent workshop and flirty icebreaker games. The big games kick off at **9pm**. Doors close at **11pm**, no admittance after this point without prior arrangement.

**Arena:** A secret location in Brooklyn. Details provided upon ticket purchase.

**Fashion Mandate:** Wear your team colors proud. Dress bright, dress sporty, dress like you’re ready to take your victory lap and claim the gold. Wear gold, wear silver, wear nothing but the flag you love. Don’t wear too much though, and don’t expect to wear it long.

**Consent Policy:** Nothing should ever happen to you at one of our events that you do not clearly and enthusiastically consent to. Violators of this policy will be firmly ejected from any event we host.

**Accessibility Notice:** Unfortunately, the venue we have secured is not wheelchair accessible. Guests will need to be able to climb a single flight of stairs to reach the space, and the building does not have an elevator. We apologize that we are not able to better accommodate all interested folk with this event; we’ll strive to provide better options at future events.
