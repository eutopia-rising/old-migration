_Prepare for a night of carnal delights unlike anything else out there. We’re taking you on an erotic evening's hayride filled with exotic sensations, sexy games, intimate exploration and unbridled ecstasy._

_Prepare for rides and attractions galore! Are you brave enough to ride Buzzy, the Non-binary Mechanical Bull? Curious to wander through the Tactile Tunnel of Love? Will you explore the hair-raising sensations under our Tent of Violet Wonders?_

_Join our mad Carnivale! Come seek your fate and fortune! Become a living work of art! Come to a place where you can safely explore new delights and become something new._

_Come with us._

- **At 9, the carnivale starts up in earnest.** The rides turn on, and all the booths and tents open for your exploration and enjoyment.

**Coordinates:** A secret location in Brooklyn. Details provided upon ticket purchase.

**Fashion Mandate:** Be the glorious future you see just over the horizon. Retropunk tribal new-wave ballroom glam, afrofuturist cyberpunk club scene, genderfabulous posthuman sparklediva. Deck your beautiful body in gold, glitter, neon, chrome, leather, latex, LEDS, rainbows, and glory. But please, **no clowns**. Clowns are creepy, not sexy. Seriously, do not come dressed as a clown. Also, FAKE leaves, please.

**Consent Policy:** Nothing should ever happen to you at one of our events that you do not clearly and enthusiastically consent to. Violators of this policy will be firmly ejected from any event we host.

**Accessibility Notice:** Unfortunately, the venue we have secured is not wheelchair accessible. Guests will need to be able to climb a single flight of stairs to reach the space, and the building does not have an elevator. We apologize that we are not able to better accommodate all interested folk with this event; we'll strive to provide better options at future events.
