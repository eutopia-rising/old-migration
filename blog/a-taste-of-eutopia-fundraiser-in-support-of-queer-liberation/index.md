A Prospect Park picnic fundraiser in support of Queer Liberation

Join us in the grass for an afternoon of flirty games, yummy snacks, and good company. The Eutopia Rising crew is coming out to Prospect Park to play, all in the name of a good cause.

We will be bringing inflatable furniture and soft stuff to lounge on, and plenty of games and crafts and other sillyness to enjoy. Tacos, hot dogs, and inappropriate giggling about same will be served up hot and fresh (vegan options will be available). All are welcome to come with us and hang out in the summer sun. We’ll be camping near [the Picnic House](https://goo.gl/maps/GLPpxU2tkYUWPcHP7) and flying all sorts of colorful banners, so we shouldn’t be hard to find.

**Eutopia Rising** is proud to support the [**Reclaim Pride Coalition**](https://reclaimpridenyc.org/) in organizing a grassroots [**Queer Liberation March and Rally**](https://www.facebook.com/events/2124948934418624/) on June 30. Many of our crew are already working hard within the coalition, and we’re excited to share a taste of what we do best with you all this Pride Month.

We will be collecting voluntary donations at the event to cover the cost of food; all extra funds collected will go directly towards supporting the March. $10 - $15 donation suggested: all are welcome regardless ability to contribute.
