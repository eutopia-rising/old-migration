**A Casual Bi-weekly Rope Share Every first and third Wednesday of the month at Horizon**

Register to attend here: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/knotwerks-registration-88956674809](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/knotwerks-registration-88956674809)

Interested in getting tied up in the world of rope bondage? Eager to expand your skills in the art and in need of pointers? Already an experienced rigger looking to share your knowledge with the community? Come down toÂ **Knotwerks** to share, learn and show off.

All skill and experience levels are welcome at this relaxed weeknight rope event. Rope will be available to borrow (and sometimes buy), but it is recommended that you bring your own if you can. An experienced facilitator will be on hand to provide guidance and instruction.

In the interests of safety, those interested in using hard points or bamboo poles for suspension will need to be cleared by the facilitators prior to getting up in the air. Having an experienced spotter on hand to monitor you is strongly recommended.
