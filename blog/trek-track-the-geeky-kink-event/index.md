The crew of the starship Eutopia Rising made first landing at The Geeky Kink Event in November 2017. We spent the weekend spreading Star Trek-themed sexy fun across the convention hotel, including a con-wide game we created called **[Holodeck Malfunction!](https://eutopia-rising.org/holodeck/)** (You can check the game out for yourself [here](https://eutopia-rising.org/holodeck/)).

We also hosted a sex toy crafting DIY seminar we called **Engineering for Your Lower Decks**, and we threw a raging **Ten Forward Party** in our suite. Captain Polyjuiced may have overdone it on vodka-soaked gagh and Romulan ale at the party, but a stellar time was had by all.
