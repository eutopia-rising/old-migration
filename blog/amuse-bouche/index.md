**A tasty evening's sampler of titillation for all genders and orientations. Drinks, snacks, social games, and flirty new faces to be found at this queer centered makeout event.**

Tickets available here: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/amuse-bouche-queer-centered-make-out-party-tickets-90470801603](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/amuse-bouche-queer-centered-make-out-party-tickets-90470801603)

"**Amuse-Bouche" simply means to "amuse the mouth". It's a single-serving bite-sized hors d'œuvre meant to whet your appetite for more exciting menu items still to come.**

Our event is similarly, an invitation and an opening. It's an opportunity to meet new folk and get a little intimate with the assistance of some light games, soft music, a cozy environment, and some mixed drinks. We provide all the right conditions to bring our saucy voyagers together --all that's left is for you to come and have a little taste.

This is an event that encourages you to come looking to kiss and to be kissed. Show up looking your most delicious, ready to get your lips moist. Bring your sweetie or roll in solo and get ready to get closer with some new friends.

**Nobody should ever feel pressured to do anything at all that they’re not into**. However, you should come expecting that folk of all sorts of genders will want to kiss your cute face. Eutopia Rising is a queer-centered collective, and we are affirmatively welcoming to every kind of orientation, all sorts of bodies, and every gender under the rainbow.

Our scrumptious Eutopian crew will be on hand to help with introductions and icebreakers, and to make sure everyone is feeling safe and comfortable. Feel free to bring your own snacks or games to share with others, or toys to show off.

This makeout event is specifically intended to help our Voyagers get to know each other and make connections in a more relaxed atmosphere than our more sexually adventurous events. If you're new to Eutopia Rising, we encourage you to make Amuse-Bouche your first stop.
