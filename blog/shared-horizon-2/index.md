Friends, lovers, magical creatures: join us Tuesday nights at the Shared Horizon Virtual Variety Show! We've got live music, sexy performances, and all sorts of other beautiful and weird shit. Every week, we want to give you an utterly unique experience that leaves you uplifted, curious, connected, informed, joyous, and maybe a bit turned on. We laugh, we cry, we sing, we dance. Sometimes we masturbate, sometimes we hang around chatting until well past midnight. The important thing is that we're together.

Like everything else we do, this event is all about active participation, and not just passive entertainment. "Hey, I want to perform sometime!" FABULOUS! Do you have something to show off? Are you a musical virtuoso? Exhibitionist weirdo? Do you have a kinky scene you’d like to do for an audience? Let us know in advance, and we’ll find a place in the lineup for you. "Um...I want to stay as far away from the spotlight as possible." OH MY GOSH THAT'S SO OKAY! You can keep your sound and video off, change into your favorite sweatpants, eat the same plate of self-care raw onions and sardines you've been looking forward to since you woke up, and leave after five minutes, if that's your jam! We are community gathering plus performance art, and we're here to offer whatever YOU need from us.

Join us on the Eutopia Rising Community Discord for ongoing chat about the event and follow-up info from our guests: [https://discord.gg/RQTPASz](https://discord.gg/RQTPASz?fbclid=IwAR1W_6dzaD8JVL9Q-ep6Mm_3i4sbeB2QX1miOocgkIE2L2eIk2Kv0xR9HUA)
