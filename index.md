**Eutopia** means “good place.” It is a dream we share in defiance, a dream of a future that we will travel to together, bringing all our joy, all our love, all our power to change the world.

**Eutopia Rising** is an event coordination and education group dedicated to forging the future of sexual culture through games and play.
