We host many of our sexy events and workshops at secret venues and private homes. In an attempt to create a safer and more comfortable space for all of our guests, it's our policy to gather some basic information about our attendees.

We call the people who we have accepted into our trusted community our **Voyagers**.

As an approved Voyager, you'll receive invitations to Eutopia Rising's private, vetted events. Before we invite you to travel along with us, we'd like to know a little bit more about who you are and what you like to do.

**Lunar Events** are adults-only parties and late night sexy fun. We carefully curate our guest list in the interests of greater safety and accountability. Lunar Voyagers are welcome to join us for Solar Events as well, if they choose. Like everything we do, enthusiastic consent is the golden rule.

**Solar Events** are focused on connection, support, comradery, and creative fun. They may be open to all ages, depending on details. We understand that sexy parties, while lovely, are not everyoneâ€™s cup of tea, so we have a separate application for those only interested in soaring with us in non-sexy ways.
